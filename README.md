# Clustering-of-Radial-Velocity-of-Galaxy-NGC7531
Cluster analysis of NGC 7531 spiral galaxy 

Analyzed a star formation of a sub spiral galaxy of 323 points in space to detect and categorize clusters of stars and 
HII regions. Created models developed in R to take a deep dive into various types of unsupervised clustering 
techniquesto group star formations, which resulted to identifying clusters of stars having greater velocity away from 
galaxies origin
